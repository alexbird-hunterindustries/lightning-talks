# Near Enemies of Advice

Some things that are like advice, but are not.

---

# Opinions
## are Near Enemies of Advice

- Advice: recommendation with reasons
- Opinion: recommendation without reasons

---

# When they give you opinions

Ask "why" to convert the opinion to advice

---

# Megamobbing
### is a Near Enemy of Asking Advice

- Megamobbing: add more people to the decision making team
- Asking advice: ask for recommendations (with reasons), but do not grow the decision making team

---

# Asking Permission
### is a Near Enemy of Asking Stakeholders for Advice

- Asking Permission: "this impacts you, may we do X?"
- Asking Stakeholders for Advice: "this impacts you, can you tell me more?"

---

# We can ask for Advice
### without giving up our autonomy

Keep control of your own decision by making sure:
 - the adviser also shares their reasoning
   - so you can determine if their recommendation is relevant
 - you make the final decision without the adviser
