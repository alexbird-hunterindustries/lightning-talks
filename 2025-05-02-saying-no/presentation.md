# Recap

Saying "no"...
 - makes others trust your "yes" more
 - makes others more comfortable suggesting/asking

---

# Challenge

Pay attention to times **you want to say "no" but you think you ought to say "yes"**
 - if it feels safe to say "no"
   - giv'r
 - if it doesn't feel safe to say "no"
   - that's a great thing to retro as a team
